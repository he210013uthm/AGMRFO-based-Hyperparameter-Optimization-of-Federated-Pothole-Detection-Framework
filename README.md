# AGMRFO-based-Hyperparameter-Optimization-of-Federated-Pothole-Detection-Framework
Potholes remain a major factor in road accidents and vehicle damage, often arising from heavy rainfall and substandard construction materials. Traditional manual detection is slow, labor-intensive, and prone to errors, while vision-based approaches face challenges such as illumination variance, noise, and difficulty in detecting small or clustered potholes. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a federated learning-based pothole detection framework that ensures data privacy while delivering high detection accuracy. The framework employs a Wavelet Triple Self-Attention EfficientNet (WTSA-EfficientNet) to enhance feature extraction and preserve fine structural details, enabling robust detection under diverse road and lighting conditions. To further improve generalization in heterogeneous and non-IID federated settings, Stochastic Normalization (StochNorm) is incorporated, dynamically balancing mini-batch and moving statistics during training. For efficient hyperparameter optimization, an Adaptive Genetic-Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (AGMRFO) algorithm is introduced, where adaptive probability crossover and mutation operators prevent premature convergence by maintaining diversity in early iterations and refining solutions in later stages. Experimental results on benchmark pothole datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 99.57% accuracy, outperforming existing approaches in both robustness and computational efficiency, and validating its effectiveness for real-world deployment in intelligent transportation systems.
The key contributions are, 

•	A modified Wavelet Triple Self-Attention EfficientNet is designed, which integrates wavelet decomposition and triplet attention to reduce redundant parameters, suppress irrelevant features, and enhance fine-scale pothole detection.

•	Stochastic Normalization is incorporated to dynamically alternate between batch statistics and moving statistics, improving model stability under small or imbalanced batches and addressing domain shift across clients.

•	A hybrid AGMRFO algorithm is integrated by combining MRFO’s foraging strategies with adaptive probability crossover and mutation. Instead of using fixed probabilities or random mutation directions this method adjusts these probabilities dynamically based on the fitness of solutions and provide better computational complexity with stable convergence.

•	 In the federated environment, AGMRFO applies these adaptive operators at the client level so that crossover and mutation respond to the data distribution of each client. This keeps the population diverse in the early stages of evolution and gradually reduces diversity later, which helps the algorithm focus on fine-tuning the best solutions.
